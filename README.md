## Introduction

This project is an example implementation of the [Open Microservice Specification](https://openmicroservices.org), a standard originally created at [Storyscript](https://storyscript.io) for building highly-portable "microservices" that expose the events, actions, and APIs inside containerized software.

## Getting Started

The `oms` command-line interface allows you to interact with Open Microservices. If you're interested in creating an Open Microservice the CLI also helps validate, test, and debug your `oms.yml` implementation!

See the [oms-cli](https://github.com/microservices/oms) project to learn more!

### Installation

```
npm install -g @microservices/oms
```

## Usage

### Open Microservices CLI Usage

Once you have the [oms-cli](https://github.com/microservices/oms) installed, you can run any of the following commands from within this project's root directory:

#### Actions

##### answer

> The Short Answers API returns a single plain text result directly from Wolfram|Alpha.
##### Action Arguments

| Argument Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|:------------- |:---- |:-------- |:--------|:----------- |
| query | `string` | `true` | None | For instance, here is a query for "How far is Los Angeles from New York?" |
| units | `enum` | `false` | None | Use this parameter to manually select what system of units to use for measurements and quantities (either "metric" or "imperial"). |
| WOLFRAM_APP_ID | `string` | `true` | None | Please create an app ID from https://products.wolframalpha.com/short-answers-api/documentation/ |

``` shell
oms run answer \ 
    -a query='*****' \ 
    -a units='*****' \ 
    -e WOLFRAM_APP_ID=$WOLFRAM_APP_ID
```

## Contributing
